/*
Problem
Chef's current rating is XX, and he wants to improve it. It is generally recommended that a person with rating XX should solve problems whose difficulty lies in the range [X, X+200][X,X+200], i.e, problems whose difficulty is at least XX and at most X+200X+200.

You find out that Chef is currently solving problems with a difficulty of YY.

 Is Chef following the recommended practice or not?
